**This library is for using ASCII characters to output your name:**

1. The only function here is **brumski::name()** which doesn't take any parameter.

2. Once the function is called, it will ask you for your name.

3. Numbers aren't allowed in your name e.g 1, 2, 3, etc.

4. Code example:




_\#include <brumski_cpp/ascii/name.hpp>_


_int main(){_

    brumski::name();

_}_
