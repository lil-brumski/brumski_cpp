To test this example, do the following:

* Download this library onto your device in any folder you want; using ```git clone https://github.com/lil-brumski/brumski_cpp.git``` inside of a terminal or command line.

* Move the `example/` directory outside of the `brumski_cpp/` directory so that they can both be in the same directory.

* Create a folder: `example/build/` from where the directory `example/` is or create a folder: `build/` inside the `example` directory.

* Enter ```cmake .. && make```

* Run the executable using `./example.o`
